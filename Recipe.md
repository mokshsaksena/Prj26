1) Soak the tamarind in hot water for 20 to 30 minutes.

2) Once the tamarind gets soft, then squeeze the tamarind in the water itself. Discard the strained tamarind and keep the tamarind pulp aside.

3)Rinse tuvar dal a couple of times in water.

4)Drain all the water and add the dal in a 2 litre pressure cooker. Also add ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder.

5)Add 1.5 to 1.75 cups water and mix. Cover and pressure cook dal for 7 to 8 whistles or 9 to 10 minutes on medium heat.

6)When the pressure settles down on its own, open the lid and check the dal. The dal should be completely cooked and mushy.

7)Mash the dal with a spoon or wired whisk. Cover and keep aside.

8)When the dal is pressure cooking – rinse, peel and chop the vegetables.

9)Take the chopped vegetables in a pan or pot. Also add 6 to 7 pearl onions or 1 small to medium onion (thickly sliced) and 1 small to medium tomato (quartered).

10)Sprinkle turmeric powder, kashmiri red chilli powder and salt as per taste. Adding kashmiri red chili powder is optional and can be skipped. 

11)Add 1.5 to 2 cups water and stir.

12)Keep the pan on a stove top and begin to cook vegetables on a medium-low to medium flame. In between do check when the vegetables are cooking.

13)Cook till the vegetables are almost done. Ensure that you don’t over cook the vegetables.

14)Once the vegetables are almost cooked, then add the tamarind pulp and 1 to 1.5 tablespoons sambar powder. Mix well.

15)Add the mashed dal. Mix again very well.

16)Simmer on a medium-low heat till the sambar comes to a boil. 

17)You will see a frothy layer on top when the sambar begins boiling. At this step switch off the heat. Cover and set aside.

18)In a small pan or tadka pan, heat 2 tablespoons gingelly oil. Add ½ tsp mustard seeds.

19)Let the mustard seeds crackle.

20)Then add 1 to 2 dry red chillies (halved and seeds removed).

21)Immediately add 10 to 12 curry leaves, 5 to 6 methi seeds and 2 pinches of asafoetida (hing). Be careful as the oil splutters while adding curry leaves.

22)Fry them till the red chilies change color and curry leaves become crisp.

23)Immediately add this tempering mixture in the hot sambar.

24)Cover the pan with its lid for 4 to 5 minutes, so that the aroma and flavors from the tempering mixture gets infused with the sambar.

25)Serve sambar hot. You can garnish it with a few coriander leaves if you prefer. It can also be served with steamed rice, idli, dosa, medu vada or uttapam.
